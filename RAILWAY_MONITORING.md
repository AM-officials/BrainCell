# 🚨 Railway Deployment Monitoring

## Current Status: Waiting for Redeploy

### What Just Happened:
1. ✅ Pushed OpenCV fix to GitHub (commit `3d715e1`)
   - Changed `opencv-python` → `opencv-python-headless`
   - Added `nixpacks.toml` with system dependencies
   - Added `Aptfile` for compatibility
2. ✅ Pushed trigger commit (commit `68a88c7`) to force redeploy
3. ⏳ **Railway should now start auto-deploying...**

---

## 📋 **Monitor Railway Deployment**

### Step 1: Watch Railway Dashboard
1. Go to Railway dashboard: https://railway.app/project/your-project
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. You should see a **NEW deployment starting** (triggered by commit `68a88c7`)

### Step 2: Check Build Logs
Look for these messages in **Build Logs**:

✅ **Expected (Good Signs):**
```
→ Installing system packages
  → libgl1-mesa-glx
  → libglib2.0-0
  → libsndfile1
  → ffmpeg
  → portaudio19-dev

→ Installing Python packages
  → opencv-python-headless==4.10.0.84
  → tensorflow==2.17.0
  → asyncpg==0.30.0
  
✓ Build completed successfully
```

❌ **If you still see:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'
```
→ Railway didn't pick up changes (see "Nuclear Option" below)

### Step 3: Check Deploy Logs
Look for:
```
Starting Container
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
✓ Database initialized
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:XXXX
```

## ⏱️ **Expected Timeline:**

| Time | What's Happening |
|------|------------------|
| 0-2 min | Railway detects GitHub push |
| 2-5 min | Installing system packages (nixpacks) |
| 5-8 min | Installing Python packages (requirements.txt) |
| 8-10 min | Starting server |
| **10 min** | ✅ **Deployment successful!** |

---

## 🔍 **Verify Deployment Success:**

### 1. Check Railway URL
```bash
curl https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy"}
```

### 2. Check Railway Logs
- Click **"View Logs"** → Filter: "All logs"
- Should see: `INFO: Application startup complete`
- **No more CV2 errors!**

### 3. Test OpenCV Import
Railway logs should show during startup:
```
✓ Database initialized
```
(No import errors means OpenCV loaded successfully)

---

## 🆘 **Nuclear Option (If Still Failing):**

If Railway **STILL** shows CV2 errors after 10 minutes:

### Option 1: Delete and Recreate Service
1. Railway dashboard → Settings → **Danger Zone**
2. Click **"Remove Service"**
3. Confirm deletion
4. Go back → **New Service** → Deploy from GitHub
5. Select `BrainCell` repo
6. Set Root Directory: `braincell_backend`
7. Add environment variables again (DATABASE_URL, GOOGLE_API_KEY, etc.)

### Option 2: Check Railway Settings
1. Settings → **Build**
2. Custom Build Command: (leave blank, let nixpacks handle it)
3. Custom Start Command: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
4. **Railway should detect `nixpacks.toml` automatically**

### Option 3: Manual Nixpacks Verification
Railway should auto-detect `nixpacks.toml`. If not:
1. Check file location: `braincell_backend/nixpacks.toml` (must be in root directory)
2. Verify it was pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/AM-officials/BrainCell/blob/main/braincell_backend/nixpacks.toml
